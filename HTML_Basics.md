# "ELEMENTS FUNDEMENTAL"
1. All elements have a tag, take note of how it looks like <tagname>CONTENT GOES INSIDE HERE</tagname> Always have a <start tag> and an </end tag>

2. All elements are not case sensitive, meaning that <P> would be the same as <p> but it is good code ethic to maintain a consistent rule, so just use lower case

# "BASIC ELEMENTS"

## <!DOCTYPE html>
    All HTML documents to start off with <!DOCTYPE html>, this is to ensure that you are telling the computer that it is a HTML5 Document

## <html>
    Next will be the root element <html> which defines the whole HTML document, there  are elements with this element which makes this element a **NESTED ELEMENT**

### <h1>
    Within the html element there are certian basic tags to remember, this is the first one, the heading with the number 1 pirority 

### <p1>
    Next will be the paragraph tags, this is self explanatory 

REMEMBER THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ELEMENTS HAVE A END TAG AS WELL

```htm
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
