            <p>This is a <strong>blog</strong> about my <em>goals</em>
            In the next 2 years, I wish to develop a <em>hybrid app</em>
            that can help students solve their <strong>paradox of choice</strong>
            and make their decisions in places to eat easier. This allows them 
            to piroritize their time on <strong>STUDIES</strong> rather than to 
            waste time deciding on what they want to eat</p>
