    <!--The selector below is a TYPE SELECTOR (ELEMENT) ANYTHING UNDER THE 
    ELEMENT WILL APPLY TO THE CSS FILE ACCORDINGLY-->
    <div>Hello, World</div>
    <div>Hello, Again!</div>
    <p>Hi...</p>
    <div>Okay, bye</div>

    <!--The selector below is a CLASS SELECTOR, anything placed under the class
    will apply to the CSS file accordingly-->
    <div class="alert-text">
        Please agree to our Terms and Services
    </div>
    <!--You can add more than one class to the class with a whitespace-->
    
    <!--Similar to class selectors, these ID SELECTORS select elements with a specific
    ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element-->
    <div id="title">My Awesome 90s Page</div>
    <!--Difference between ID and class selector:
    1. An element can only have ONE ID
    2. ID cannot be repeated on a single page
    3. An ID cannot have any whitespace at all
    
    Use IDs sparingly, if it requires more specificity in style, if not just use CLASS-->
    
    <!--See css file to understand GROUP SELECTORS, used when selectors have
    duplicated declarations-->
    <div class="read">
        This is an example of group selectors used, to minimise repetition
    </div>
    <div class="unread">
        Unread selector will also get the same declaration as read
    </div>
    
    <!--CHAIN SELECTORS, chained as a list without seperation, used for class with a whitespace-->
    <div>
        <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
        <p class="subsection preview">This is a preview of the posts</p>
        <!--A class and a ID can be chained together, in this format-->
        <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is the corrected preview of posts</p>
    </div>
    <!--Chaining type selectors do not work as it will try to find a <divp> instead of
    seperate selectors <div> and <p>-->
    
    <!--DESCENDANT COMBINATORS is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. 
    A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if 
    they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc) that matches the previous selector.-->
    <div class="ancestor">ALPHA
        <div class="child">BRAVO
            <div class="child">CHARLIE
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="child">DELTA</div>
    <!--NOTICE how only the descendants receive the css attributes, thus making it a
    descendant combinator, try to minimise a high level of nesting as it can
    get very confusing-->
    
    <!--Introduction to the CSS colors and the different formats-->
